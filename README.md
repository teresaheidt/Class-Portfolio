# Portfolio
## Table of contents:
## How I built this:
I used Bootstrap CSS framework to recreate my portfolio and to make my project responsive. The user will see a completed index.html file, a portfolio.html page and a contact.html page.
Each pages are linked. You can easily navigate between pages using the NAV BAR, which is located at the head of each of the three pages.
At the bottom of each of the three pages is a sticky FOOTER with copywright.
## What does this do:
This is a mobile-first application, with responsive design so that no matter what size screen you are viewing the application on, the images and the text fits the space.
## How to use:
The user will arrive on the main screen where they will see my 'About me' page. On this page is a responsive img of myself and a short bio under the image. At the top of the page is a nav bar, with 'About', 'Portfolio' and 'Contact' links. When the user hovered over any one of these links, the color changes from light grey to blue. 
* When the user clicks on the 'Portfolio' link they will be taken to that page where three of my projects will be displayed, with a responsive img and a link to the project itself.
* After clicking the link, another browser will open and the user will be taken to the website.
* When the user clicks on the 'Contact'link they will be taken to the contact page where they can fill out the following; name, email and message.
